i3 Configuration
================================================================================

I like minimalism in my Linux system, so I use [`i3`](https://i3wm.org/) as my
window manager. This repository tracks my configuration files for this window
manager.

I recommend cloning this repository with my tool,
[ConfigManager](https://github.com/hendrik-s-debruin/ConfigManager)
